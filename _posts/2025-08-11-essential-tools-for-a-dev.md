![An illustration of me working, created by Elene Chekurishvili (check out her other awesome works here)](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*kKTcOHl3cm6w6ANbp6sqFw.jpeg)

These types of blogs are always interesting to me because it’s important to understand what other people find to be the most helpful and comfortable tools to work with on a daily basis.

In our field especially, as we spend most of the day at our laptops and our work is purely digital, understanding the useful combinations of apps is as important as it gets. And, I’ve come to appreciate the importance of showing gratitude for truly functional and well-designed apps.

That’s why I wanted to share some of my absolute favorite tools that are an integral part of my daily routines, with small sneak peeks into how I use them most often and which features are my favorites, along with links to try them out yourselves too.

**Arc**
-------

This is my personal favorite — not only something I use while working but for my personal tasks as well. Discovering [**Arc**](https://arc.net/gift/6e7cd7bc) really changed how I interact with the internet, and I’m very grateful for its existence.

There are many features that make it stand out from the rest of the browsers for me:

*   **Vertical tabs to maintain a clear view of your work**

![captionless image](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*ywtYB7FL05IPT7BS7zagPQ.gif)

*   **Favorites to pin your most frequently used pages right there**

![captionless image](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*wbu5dZ_Xpl4x8YDrQ1VF2A.gif)

*   **Spaces to keep your browser clean and uncluttered**

![captionless image](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*_kcUcTiKKenUG4O0quwCBw.gif)

*   **Extensive customization options and a stunning, aesthetic UI**

![captionless image](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*KiBfXFzmIoozssp37eVWqw.gif)

*   **Personalized approach from the team and regular updates**

![captionless image](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*aW3-aMCgqph1hQ_JZ2yAmQ.gif)

In most cases, browsers for us are just a means to an end — to reach our favorite web pages. But in this case, I believe it’s an end in itself and satisfying to use even on its own.

If you have not tried it yet, that’s the first thing you should do. Check it out [**_from this link_**](https://arc.net/gift/6e7cd7bc) and I might even get gifted with a cool new Arc icon.

IntelliJ IDEA
-------------

As a Java developer, no tool tops my list like IntelliJ IDEA. This IDE is incredibly powerful and versatile, offering every feature you could need for writing code.

While the Ultimate version is packed with advanced features, the Community version is also highly capable and more than sufficient for most users. Here are some reasons why IntelliJ IDEA is irreplaceable for me:

*   **Intelligent code completion to help finish the sentences you’ve started**

![captionless image](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*WRZvuuWcMN-VmnA1ZKaB3g.gif)

*   **Seamless integration with Git and build tools**

![captionless image](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*fvNlTYqihK3k8qeHAIh8aw.gif)

*   **Helpful resources to learn IDE features and become a pro user**

![captionless image](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*vjJ_YTgfEuOIMgMfVtqmFA.gif)

Frequent updates, a responsive development team that addresses issues quickly, and the cleanest, most functional interface I’ve ever seen in any IDE are just a few reasons why IntelliJ IDEA stands out.

The points I’ve covered are just the tiny glimpses of what this IDE can do. It definitely deserves its own blog post — or even a whole blog series!

**_** If you’re interested in exploring its features and capabilities further, let me know. I’d love to hear your thoughts and feedback!_**

Warp
----

Not much time has passed since I discovered [**Warp**](https://app.warp.dev/referral/4ZY3PZ) — modern and powerful terminal solution, which I now use almost daily when working from the command line.

*   **UI customization options to help you feel comfortable**

![captionless image](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*F6_TJug5treos7YiMwXGQQ.gif)

*   **Natural language detection to make describing what you need much easier**

![captionless image](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*mU8EpPeajY8_ysBMaZPaGw.gif)

*   **Turning commands into workflows so you never have to repeat the same task twice**

![captionless image](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*UHkAANQPjIFPLxMcvGcCTQ.gif)

*   **Memorizing previous commands so you never forget what you need**

![captionless image](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*9ASkndqhDeOATeUcGDp12Q.gif)

Currently, it’s only available for Linux and Mac users, but don’t you worry, you can join the Windows waitlist.

Check it out [**_using this referral link_**](https://app.warp.dev/referral/4ZY3PZ) if you’d like me to get a new cool theme.

Postman
-------

[**This API platform**](https://www.postman.com/) has become an industry standard for building and testing APIs. Its intuitive UI is easy to use for amateurs and non-technical users alike, but it also includes many advanced features that are highly valued by enterprise companies.

Some of my personal daily go-tos are:

*   **Response history to go back in time and find that elusive response**

![captionless image](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*G_FM3i-OpbReMsUSX0g-fA.gif)

*   **Request format conversion to seamlessly switch between formats**

![captionless image](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*5RLFw29hchrjdAuuxk37NA.gif)

*   **Scripts to automate repetitive tasks or transform your data**

![captionless image](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*CaiZoJciaLghesJz7Ps71w.gif)

*   **Collections to organize and manage your requests efficiently**

![captionless image](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*mkRUbd2z0BnYoM4eVCFocQ.gif)

*   **Comments to add notes and keep track of important details**

![captionless image](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*d_eRR45VI1FPqclCxSdOkA.gif)

This is just a humble list of beginner-friendly features. Check out sharing collections, synchronizing workspaces, and much more for yourself.

DevToys
-------

Which developer does not need a help in doing quick and specific tiny tasks? none. [**DevToys**](https://devtoys.app/) is there to help you with anything you can think of.

Even though you can find most features online on separate pages by Googling them, having them all in one place, running locally on your machine, is very comfortable.

*   **JWT decoder/encoder**

![captionless image](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*_acDxybUksA6fP15mmQfPg.gif)

*   **Hash generator**

![captionless image](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*WJRjEko7NWkOrW4cUYSHWA.gif)

*   **UUID generator**

![captionless image](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*akiydWiA3wmsP9q_BxvbGw.gif)

*   **Lorem ipsum generator**

![captionless image](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*QOCAxLWacyuVPJmSH97Exg.gif)

*   **Text diff**

![captionless image](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*BM-Auix0_OsSNWF6W2EJDA.gif)

I mean, you can see the long list of features above. It’s like a Swiss Army knife for developers and definitely worth exploring.

Notion
------

[**Notion**](https://www.notion.so) is also one of my recent discoveries. I’ve used many similar tools in the past, but none offer as much customization. It’s simple yet very powerful, and I’m sure I’ve only scratched the surface of what it can do. However, here are some of my favorite features:

*   **Clear separation of pages to keep your space organized**

![captionless image](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*c9YsKIeZme4_HORLqlG3hg.gif)

*   **Endless formatting options to better express yourself**

![captionless image](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*JRR1pp9P8XL6x30qEJTf5Q.gif)

*   **AI support, of course**

![captionless image](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*E7SRO8oe8mdhQWOe0yYCYQ.gif)

Whether it’s a simple aesthetic to-do list, notes, or high-level research, I believe this versatile app can be used in any way.

I wish I were a super-user, but I guess the joy is in the journey ahead.

Maccy
-----

I believe a good clipboard manager is essential for all users. I constantly need to copy and paste snippets around the IDE or chats and frequently refer to my clipboard history. This is where [**Maccy**](https://maccy.app/) shines:

*   **Preserving not only text but screenshots too, because you never know**

![captionless image](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*am_WXqKnzPGNF_46Q78hZw.gif)

*   **Various customization options to make it fit your needs**

![captionless image](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*Msp_gUHgtoKsOCIbJLK5Yw.gif)

As the name suggests, Maccy is for Mac users. However, I can also recommend alternatives for other systems that I have used and loved: [**Diodon**](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Diodon) _(for Linux)_ and [**Ditto**](https://ditto-cp.sourceforge.io/) _(for Windows)_.

Flameshot
---------

![Image source: Flameshot’s official web page](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/0*84EVS2Jt7VRu4_S5.jpg)

This [**open-source screenshot software**](https://flameshot.org/) is my absolute favorite. I’ve tried many similar tools, but none have been as comfortable to use.

I even remember that on my Linux machine, the shortcut to launch the tool stopped working after an update. I spent many hours trying to fix it ([**_and fixed, finally_**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ubuntu/comments/172bjob/comment/kemxkvi/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)) — that’s how essential it is! Here’s why:

*   **In-app screenshot editing because you gotta highlight your ideas**

![captionless image](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*x7IEzaXHRP5gUL4CrPym-w.gif)

*   **Highly customizable to help you express**

![captionless image](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1156/format:webp/1*4b_r-Hno4RtzML2Rq1D8MQ.gif)

If you haven’t used it before, now is the perfect time to give it a try!

Slack
-----

When it comes to communication, [**Slack**](https://slack.com/) is my go-to app for staying connected with not only my team members, but friends and family too. Once you start using Slack, it’s tough to consider moving to another app. Here are some of my favorite features:

*   **Channels to organize conversations and keep discussions focused**

![Image source: Slack’s official web page](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*9N-fbE3115VoLRuLzTz4Fw.png)

*   **Messaging to communicate instantly and keep everyone in the loop**

![Image source: Slack’s official web page](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*Z6aRT3GCOcBRaQjFdBG-9g.png)

*   **Multiple emoji reactions to add some fun (very important!)**

![captionless image](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/0*hx8qW2RrmeogFthl.png)

*   **Seamless integration with apps to keep everything connected**

![captionless image](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*z4ya6LFnDvs-FjLwzm429g.gif)

*   **Huddles for spontaneous voice (and not only) conversations**

![captionless image](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*riB-QqqwKS_ZEkRgZC8Myw.png)

*   **Predefined or custom themes to personalize your workspace and match your style**

![captionless image](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*QHQl_90Tc8sUaSm5ukNhzw.gif)

Slack is simple and comfortable, giving off cozy, warm vibes, and in my opinion, it even helps foster a friendly and inclusive atmosphere within the team. So, if your company hasn’t adopted it yet, give it a pitch!

Spotify
-------

[**Spotify**](https://open.spotify.com/) has been an essential part of my daily life for quite a while now. As a premium user, I don’t regret spending a few bucks on its high-quality music, especially when the app offers a lot of features.

*   **Daily mixes to give you a perfect blend of your favorite tracks**

![captionless image](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/0*60eJVm5aHkdESmTM.jpg)

*   **Powerful search by genre to quickly find the perfect tracks for any mood**

![captionless image](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*Yb1TXq4pX5NdJWfB9KYxaQ.gif)

Shared jams, recommended stations, favorite artists, popular radios and much more— there’s a lot to discover and enjoy depending on your mood.

There are other tools that didn’t make it into my top-10 list but that I really enjoy using, like [**NotchNook**](https://lo.cafe/notchnook), [**Giphy Capture**](https://giphy.com/apps/giphycapture), [**Sublime Text**](https://www.sublimetext.com/), [**Rectangle**](https://rectangleapp.com/), [**Hidden Bar**](https://apps.apple.com/fi/app/hidden-bar/id1452453066?mt=12), [**Scroll Reverser**](https://pilotmoon.com/scrollreverser/), [**Karabiner-Elements**](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/), and many more.

I’m excited to discover new and intriguing apps, so let me know your essential tools or if you relate to any of my favorites.
