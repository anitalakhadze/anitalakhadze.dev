I’m a Java backend developer who builds practical systems and writes about the parts most tutorials skip. I work with Spring Boot and care about clear, understandable code.

## 🛠️ What I usually work with
- Building and maintaining Spring Boot microservices with IntelliJ IDEA
- Working with MongoDB and PostgreSQL
- Writing unit tests and integration tests using Cucumber
- Working with Docker and GitLab CI for builds and pipelines, often on OpenShift
- Communicating with teammates and business representatives
- Documenting processes and decisions

## 📝 What I write about
Most of my blogs live on [Medium](https://medium.com/@anitalakhadze). I like answering questions I’ve asked myself — and probably ones you've asked too:

- What is software entropy?
- Should I squash my Git commits?
- Is OpenFeign better than WebClient?
- How to write a proper custom validator?

## 🕊️ How to reach me
- [Email](mailto:talakhadzeani@gmail.com)  
- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ani-t-4961b210b/)  
- [Medium](https://medium.com/@anitalakhadze)  

## 🤸🏻‍♀️ Fun fact
I’ve argued more about naming things than about actual business logic.
