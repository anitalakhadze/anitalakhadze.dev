I’m a Java backend developer who builds practical systems and writes about the parts most tutorials skip. 

I work with Spring Boot, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Docker, and GitLab CI, often on OpenShift, and I care about clear, understandable code. 

My blogs explore questions I’ve asked myself - and probably ones you’ve asked too — like software entropy, Git commit strategies, OpenFeign versus WebClient, or writing proper custom validators. I have some thoughts about some other stuff and sometimes I write them here too.

When I’m not coding or writing, I’m usually debating naming conventions more than business logic. 

You can reach me via [email](talakhadzeani@gmail.com), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anitalakhadze/), or [Medium](https://medium.com/@anitalakhadze). Pigeons would work as well, but not too reliable I guess 🤸🏻‍♀️
